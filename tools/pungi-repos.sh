# Rewrite the working tree to build from the PUNGI pre-release repositories
# (https://<arch>-pungi-<major>.almalinux.dev) instead of repo.almalinux.org.
# This allows building images before an AlmaLinux version is publicly
# released.
#
# The PUNGI compose mirrors the public repository layout exactly (same
# <Repo>/<arch>/os, BaseOS/<arch>/kickstart/, isos/<arch>/ with identical
# file names), so every rewrite is a per-arch prefix substitution:
#
#   https://repo.almalinux.org/almalinux/<major>
#     -> https://<archdash>-pungi-<major>.almalinux.dev/almalinux/<major>/<arch>/latest_result_almalinux/compose
#
# where <archdash> is the arch with underscores dashed for the host name
# (x86_64 -> x86-64, x86_64_v2 -> x86-64-v2; aarch64/ppc64le/s390x as-is)
# and <arch> is taken from the URL's own path.
#
# Rewritten files:
#   - variables.pkr.hcl                  (iso_url_* / iso_checksum_* locals
#                                         for 9/10)
#   - http/*.ks                          ('url --url' and 'repo --baseurl')
#   - almalinux*gencloud*.xml.tmpl       (the <url> element, s390x)
#
# The kickstarts preinstall the packages the post-reboot Ansible
# provisioning used to install with dnf (see the note in their %packages
# sections). For the installs that DO stay in Ansible (cloud-init where a
# kickstart cannot carry it, provider guest agents, VirtualBox Guest
# Additions build dependencies, GCP's google-* packages from Google's
# own repository, ...) the script appends a %post section
# to the same kickstarts that writes /etc/yum.repos.d/pungi.repo,
# pointing dnf at the PUNGI compose BaseOS/AppStream with priority=1 so
# they shadow the released-version repositories at provisioning time.
# On GCP only the AlmaLinux dependencies of the google-* packages are
# affected - the Google repository itself is untouched.
# Without it those installs mix released-version packages into the
# pre-release system - fatal where versions must match the running
# kernel (the VirtualBox Guest Additions build installs kernel-devel /
# kernel-headers, which otherwise cannot match the compose kernel). A
# task removing the override is injected into the cleanup_vm role (the
# last role of every playbook), so shipped images keep only the standard
# repositories.
#
# The AWS AMIs (ansible/roles/ami_<major>_<arch>) are built differently:
# a surrogate EBS volume is chroot-bootstrapped from a running source
# instance, and the almalinux-repos package seeds the chroot with the
# released-version repositories. The script injects a task into the
# roles' os.yaml that writes the same pungi.repo into both the source
# instance (host) and the /rootfs chroot right after that - the chroot
# dnf steps then install from the compose. The host copy matters for the
# 9 roles, whose 'Update the system' task uses the ansible dnf module
# and reads the host repository configuration. A removal task injected
# into cleanup.yaml drops the override from both places before the
# volume is snapshotted.
#
# Intentionally NOT rewritten:
#   - AlmaLinux 8: no PUNGI hosts exist - 8 keeps building from
#     repo.almalinux.org.
#   - AlmaLinux Kitten: a rolling, stream-based OS with no releases -
#     kitten.repo.almalinux.org already IS the latest compose, so there is
#     no pre-release state to switch to. Kitten keeps its public repos.
#
# The script is idempotent: PUNGI URLs do not match the public-host
# patterns, so a second run is a no-op. No arguments.
